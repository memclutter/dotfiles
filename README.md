# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! Here, you'll find the configuration files for Vim and Git, as well as some other useful settings. These dotfiles help me maintain a consistent development environment across different machines.

Feel free to fork this repository and adapt these dotfiles to your own preferences. Happy coding!
